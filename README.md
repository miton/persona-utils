Random things related to Persona 3 FES. Half of the workings of a fusion calculator for making specialized personas, but I found it less annoying to just edit them instead as you'll end up rerolling the fusions forever.

Would not take much to make some sort of GUI to make it more userfriendly, but there are still things I don't really understand such as partial progress on social links, inventory, which of several abilities are the real ones, etc.

Thanks to Florian for his blog posts about the save game format that saved a bit of time such as: http://mehm.net/blog/?p=295
